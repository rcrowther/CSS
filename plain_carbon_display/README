= Plain Carbon Display
A4 width display-orientated text for wiki/instruction sheets.

Inspiration from Mozilla wiki. 

== Changes from original
Layout is A4 20cm margin

Headers are pressed into a ''book'-like system.

The footer is from instruction-book, with the logo and title to the left, not right.

boxouts are reinvented as tip, note, and warning, then colored as per original (tip colour is new)

blockquote added

The interesting list structure, heavily used on the wiki, with levels differentiated by bullets, is formalized.


definition lists are added from instruction sheet

A simple left aligned image, as per original. But width has been limited (not original).

== State of play
May need better image handling


== HTML

=== Generalities

All content should be surrounded by ''article' or ''section'.

All text should be surrounded by ''p'

=== Titles
The headings are pressed into a system like ''book' (the original only has three headings of any intent). Most instruction sheets will need an h1, h3 for sections, and then sequentially deeper.



== The footer
In an instruction leaflet, the footer carries much of the meta-data,

#.cb
footer
	div  class="person"
	  author Robert Crowther
#

or,

#.cb
footer
  div class="organisation"
	img class="logo"
    h2 Sensor Systems
    address Aimless Boulevard
    address class="printer"
#

Either of the above can be followed by,

#.cb
  div class="doc-data"
    div class="copyright" Registered trademark of ...
    div class="reference"  HC 58746
	date July 2016
#







== CSS Notes
Sans font, normal weight, is used, except for local effects.
 


=== Sizing
Is by pixel.
