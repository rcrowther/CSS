= Book
Max-width print-orientated text for books.

Book is a bit of an oddity. It is based in the 'Memoir' subclass of the ''Latex' subclass of Tex. Of course, it has nothing of the flexibility or quality of that code. It copies the rough formatting of the default settings into CSS.

The Memoir package is an odd but useful package, which covers the idea of sections in a book, addding many heading and layout options, and a few other extras. It is useful both for text books, and fictional works. It's major lack, or the items it does not cover, are figures, and technical diagrams.

This CSS is rough approximation of the ''Demo2' heading style, with the ''memman' subheading styles.

Titles and blockqotes provided.


== State of play
Needs adding:
Figures (from Latex?)
more heading options
lists
cite 

Chapter fonts look too big, by far?


== HTML

=== Generalities

All content should be surrounded by ''article'.

All text should be surrounded by ''p'

=== Significant Memoir omissions
Memoir is modest in claims and sophisticated at setting verse. This would require a seperate module, so nothing is done with ''pre'.

=== Titles
Memoir provides ''book' part, and six levels of titling. This is impossible in the HTML six levels.

We could force the issue using nested sections/articles, but HTML Spec recommends using heading rank to represent nesting level.

The solution is to drop /subsubhead and /subparagraph. This leaves h1 as the general title, good for search engines.


==== Book title, h1

Memoir has simple main taiting, inherited from Latex. For a front page, custom titling is recommended. Following this model, the title HTML structure recommended is sophisticated, but the rendering is CSS is basic.

H1 can be simple, or expanded,

#.cb
header
     h1  Book
     p  CSS for articles and books</p> 
     div
       author  Robert Crowther
       date  July 2016
#

The ''div' contains the metadata

#.cb
  h1
    span class="name" Chapter
    span class="num" 7
    span class="title" title text...
#

== h2/h3 Part/chapter
H2, H3 can optionally be,

#.cb
   h2
     span class="name" Part
     span class="num" 4
     span class="title" title text...
#

== h3 alternatives
Commented out are some quick shots at alternate styles. So far, Default and Chappel.


== h4/h5 section/subsection
H2, H3 can optionally be,

#.cb
   h4
     span class="num" 4
     title text...
#

=== Figures

==== Images
A lightly-padded page-width image.

figure
  img
  figcaption (optional)
 




== CSS Notes
Serif font is used, except for local effects (some section headers).
 


=== Sizing
Is by point.
