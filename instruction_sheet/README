= Instruction Sheet
A4 width print-orientated text for instruction sheets.

Most of the general text layout is based in ''book'. A new, very simple ''h1' is added, and a fancy footer to hold contact information, etc. The chapter heading is set as ''komalike', and all text is sans.

Through ''book', several text-layout features are present.

All text should be surrounded by ''p'

=== Titles
Book provides six levels of titling. Most instruction sheets will need an h1, h5 for stepped instructions. h3 could be used for parts.



== The footer
In an instruction leaflet, the footer carries much of the meta-data,

#.cb
footer
	div  class="person"
	  author Robert Crowther
#

or,

#.cb
footer
  div class="organisation"
	img class="logo"
    h2 Sensor Systems
    address Aimless Boulevard
    address class="printer"
#

Either of the above can be followed by,

#.cb
  div class="doc-data"
    div class="copyright" Registered trademark of ...
    div class="reference"  HC 58746
	date July 2016
#







== CSS Notes
Sans font is used, except for local effects (some section headers).
 


=== Sizing
