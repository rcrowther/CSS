      <p class="scene-action">
This is how to begin your film or television screenplay.  
Scene headings are typed in capitals and must indicate: 
interior or exterior, the location, and day or night. 
</p>
      <p class="scene-action">
	Scene action is double-spaced under the heading in upper 
	and lower case text with double-spacing between paragraphs. 
      </p>
      <p class="scene-action">
	Scene action should only deal with what is happening on the 
	screen and must never stray into superfluous novelistic 
	text related to character thoughts or back-story. 
      </p>
      <p class="scene-action">
	A general rule of thumb is to limit a paragraph of scene 
	action to four or five lines.  Consider each paragraph as a 
	significant beat of action within your scene

      <p class="scene-description">
	It's sometimes a good idea to start a new scene on a new 
	page if there is only a line or two at the bottom of the 
	previous one, but scenes can break over the page easily 
	like this.  Shooting scripts include CONTINUED at the top 
	of the page, but this is unnecessary in a spec script. 
      </p>
      <p class-"scene-action-instruction">LATER</p>
      <p class="scene-description">
	If you need to indicate the passing of time through the 
	same scene then use LATER as a sub-heading.  There is no 
	need to continuously repeat the master scene heading. 
      </p>
      <p class-"scene-action-instruction">THE CORNER OF THE ROOM</p> 
      <p class="scene-description">
	Similarly, you can break up lengthy and complex scenes by 
	focussing on specific areas of action with a sub-heading.  
	This is useful when scripting large party or group scenes. 
      </p>

	It is standard practice to sign-off a film script with THE 
	END centred on the page, preceded by FADE OUT.  
      </p>
      <p class="scene-action">
	FADE OUT. only ever appears at the end of a feature-length 
	screenplay, or an act in a television script.  If you want 
	to indicate a FADE OUT. and a FADE IN: within the body of 
	the script, then the correct transitional term is FADE TO: 
	as above.  
      </p>
      <p class="scene-action">
	However, as mentioned earlier, scene transitions should be 
	avoided in spec scripts where possible.
