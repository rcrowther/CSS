= Computer Book
Max-width display-orientated text for representing computer code.

Based in a few computer books (Step into Scala?). Includes CSS for computer code.

Codeblock and image (only full width) figures with captions can be made. Inline codeblocks and definition lists also available.

Should play ok with ''booknav.css' and ''webbook.css', from /book

Originally inherited book, but now standalone.

== State of play
Needs fixing:
text_right, center
some form of print-block
figure/paragraphing

== HTML

=== Generalities

All content should be surrounded by ''article'.

All text should be surrounded by ''p'


=== Inline Code Blocks
Used to present directly relevant code.

Code blocks,

#.cb
  pre
    code
#

Result blocks (have extra top/bottom/left margin),

#.cb
  pre class=result
    code
#

=== Figures

==== Images
A lightly-padded page-width image.

figure
  img
  figcaption (optional)


==== Code Block
Not the same as an inline code block (for longer/summary listings),

figure
  pre
    code
  figcaption (optional)



== CSS Notes
Georgia font is used, with letter spacing reduced, as some sort of like-book compromise.
 


=== Sizing
Is by pixel.
