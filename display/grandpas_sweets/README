= Grandpa's sweets

Set of titles for ''book'. Has some additions for use on the web.

Grandpa's Sweets pushes 'book' styling towards advertising. It uses massive steps in font sizing and multiple font-effects. These are implemented by sometimes non-standard CSS. I think, short of curved-path SVG effects, it's about as far as I can go.

== Not right
The ''chapter' title surrounding box should not be full width, but text width and centred. This is not possible with current CSS/Book HTML (the inner spans are for data (the style should cover all such data, and inline blocking a headline would cause following text to wrap after). It can be done using a wrapping box (then set to display:inline-block and margins:auto)...

The h3 chapter title and links seems to degrade in some print scenarios (no surprise).

== Inconsistent
The anchors use {display:inline-block;} to ensure anchor paddiing establishes space between elements.

== TODO
Not fully considered print effects

Responsive design may need further work.

== Sizing
By point
