Overrides for book.css when used on the web.

== Webbook
''webbook.css' is a small file that adds web specifics to book.css

=== Text style
Is changed to a generic serif font and greyed.

=== Responsive queries
The standard book display is made rougly responsive. It sets stock to be flexible, and kills side and some top margins.

=== Figured images
In book.css these are handled by changing figure margins. But on the web this will result in fractional image sizes.

The offered solution is to assume the Medieval stock, then calculate and round image sizes. These sizes are then applied to images. This means images can be cropped to size, and will always fit if the screen is large.

The approch fails is stock size is changed, and the fixed dimensions will need recalculating.

=== xx-narrow images
These vanish on narrow screens. The offered solution is to use a media query to enlarge to x-narrow.
 
=== TOC
Typographic tables of content present considerable problems when transfered to the web. While translation of typographic standards may be instructive, and usable, the TOC layout fails in several ways. First, it must be adjusted to work without page numbers. After that, the layout will be deficient. Human interface guidelines tell us,

@ Even for able users, link areas are preferred to be large.
@ Web links must be clearly demarked as links
@ Different colours are not enough, as they are unusable by the colourblind --- shapes must change

Of these, the adjusted old layout in the printable 'book.css' succeeds in only one aspect --- it is clearly laid out. And it fails in yet another --- book TOCs must often contain a great deal of content, so were designed to be compact; but a web TOC will not usually have much content.

I suspect old printers would have objected to current typography. Not because they could not manage colour, animation or scaling (they took pleasure in demonstrating their effects), but because a TOC is not that important. Titles are nothing, a navigation aid to content.

I'm not saying I've solved the problem, but some styles are presented.

HTML should be like this,

nav .toc toc-groove
    h5 .toc-subtitle
        animals
    ul .toc-list
        li
            a href="hares"
                span .title
                    hares
            a href="levrets"
                span .title
                    levrets
    h5 .toc-subtitle
        span .num
            7
        span .title 
            Deer

The theme must span the lists, not sit with them. This was decided so each block can contain sublists. The purpose of the spans is for intoducing the elipsis.


  
=== Implementation of TOC as links
All styles assume an internal anchor inside the list tag wrapping the visible contents.

nav .toc .toc-groove
  ul .toc-list
    a 
      span .num
      span .title
      
Unless the TOC fills the page, contained 'ul' tags should be classed 'wide'. That's a start, as the override wide styling provides extended internal padding, so the anchor becomes larger.

Currently, three themes are available.





== BookNav

''booknav.css' is a small file that contains...
- a navigation topbar
- a breadcrumb theme


=== Breadcumb
Only one theme. You could, for example, add ''large0'.

Lightweight, and not dependant, so can be placed wherever you like, left, right, center.


=== Navigation topbar
The navbar is split off as a seperate 'book-styled' item. This creates more CSS, to ensure the bar appears as it should, but also means a 'book-styled' bar can be used in pages containing other CSS.
 
Navbars are not part of a containing article or section. They belong to the site. In W3 HTML5 draft spec they are shown as a first child of the body tag.

This means they sit above the typeblock, whereas in typography they would be inside the typeblock. This probably means we have to compensate on stock size. And if we want them to be part of the block, we need to trim the block top and replace it over the topbar.

And, much as I would like a navbar to replicate a book by borrowing, say, subhead styling, using h? tags is web-bad.

Also, a navbar can be either a 'header' or a 'nav' tag. Both of which can occur plentifully elsewhere.

At least the styling is straightforward. Headers are nearly always two lines high, in a slightly enlarged font?

The typography decisions are not simple, either. 

There was a plan to make a full width alternative, but currently the navbar is centred.

Responsive is builtin (see below). 

Size can be easily changed, for example, add ''large0'.

Themes are available, 
?css
    .bk-navbar-ruled
    .bk-navbar-boxes
    .bk-navbar-w3
?
and a helper,
?css
    .bk-navbar-to-select
?


=== Responsive
On small screens, the basic setup stacks.

If ''.bk-navbar-dropdown' is added, and a ''.bk-navbar-dropdown-mark' placed in the HTML, the CSS makes a dropdown menu. The dropdown mark is inline blocked, and styled to the right. Text rendering, and so navbar size, is enlarged considerbly, to huge1. The responsive bar is styled to expect a font-based icon.

Some font-based icon suggestions,

This is a unicode codepoint for three horizontal bars. It is lightweight, and looks good as a deliberately minimal and bold mark,
?html
        <span class="bk-navbar-dropdown-mark">&#x2261;</span>
?
There are two dropdown SVG images included in the package. One is a 16x16 four-bar mark, it looks neat. The other is a 24x24 four bar mark with rules, which looks technical.
 
Both could be used as imports, in which case they will cache. They will also work inline. Fourbar,

?html
<span class="bk-navbar-dropdown-mark">&#x2261;
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 auto">
<g stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke="#000">
<line x1="2" y1="2" x2="14" y2="2" />
<line x1="2" y1="6" x2="14" y2="6" />
<line x1="2" y1="10" x2="14" y2="10" />
<line x1="2" y1="14" x2="14" y2="14" />
</g>

</span>
?

fourbar ruled,
