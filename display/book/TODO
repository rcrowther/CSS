There is a lurking problem with lists. I'm more or less assuming paragraphing, but it's not present in the tests. Rendering paragraphed list items always falls appart in browsers.

This has been cured in computerbook using a tricky inline rule li p:fist-child. But this may throw the default/wide spacing off.
