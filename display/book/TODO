There is a lurking problem with lists. I'm more or less assuming paragraphing, but it's not present in the tests. Rendering paragraphed list items always falls appart in browsers.

This has been cured in computerbook using a tricky inline rule li p:first-child. But this may throw the default/wide spacing off.

Enable divblock. computerbook says it's good.

Now I have tables and images goining into figures, I need to figure out consistent approach to styling and expansion. I do know what size they should be....
