= Book
Max-width print-orientated text for books.

Book is an oddity. It is based in the 'Memoir' subclass of the ''Latex' subclass of Tex. Of course, it has nothing of the flexibility or quality of that code. It copies the rough formatting of the default settings into CSS.

The Memoir package is an odd but useful package, which covers the idea of sections in a book, adding many heading and layout options, and a few other extras. It is useful both for technical books/papers and fictional works. It's major lack, or the items it does not cover, are mathematical notations/technical diagrams. It is apologetic about, yet handy for, poetry. 

This CSS is rough approximation of the ''Demo2' heading style, with the ''memman' subheading styles.

The styling is based both in source Tex code and a sample generated at 12pt. Using a Debain Tex installation, to re-construct the sample,

Titles and blockqotes provided.

== Not right
Definition lists use float, so multi-lines do not display with hanging indent.

Ordered lists do not have enough space before number and item. However, CSS fixes are extreme.

For Table of Contents, HTML is unable to provide the same information (see below).


== State of play

TODO: 
Little 'section' text-indent not checked.
No num?
Autonum?
remove title attr?
responsive display?


Needs adding:
some chapter heading missing
Are the image boxes, in particular, cross-browser?
Should image figures have more vertical space?

== Printing
''book' takes a tangental approach to print and display.

Despite being a ''print' implementation, the style does not implement more advanced page CSS---verso/recto pages, counted titling etc. Reason being, ''book' is designed to be a printable view, WYSIWIG, not a complete book design package.

It provides some printblock alternatives, but these are centred, as would be expected for such a purpose.



== HTML

=== Generalities

All content should be surrounded by ''article'.

All text should be surrounded by ''p'

=== Significant Memoir omissions
Titles default to title font, but need ''title' and ''num' tags to display decorations. 

Memoir is modest in claims and sophisticated at setting verse. This would require a seperate module, so nothing is done with ''pre'.


=== Titles
Memoir provides ''book', ''part', and six levels of titling. It also offers a ''title' macro. This is impossible in the HTML six levels.

We could force the issue using nested sections/articles, but HTML Spec recommends using heading rank to represent nesting level. Similarly, the use of CSS classes is rejected.

The solution is to drop \book, \paragraph, and \subparagraph.


==== Book title, h1

Memoir has simple main titling, inherited from Latex---for a front page, custom titling is recommended. Following this model, the title HTML structure recommended is sophisticated, but the rendering CSS is basic.

The CSS is a fabricated from Memoir ''book' and ''title'.

H1 can be simple, or expanded,

#.cb
header
     h1  Book
     p  CSS for articles and books</p> 
     div
       author  Robert Crowther
       date  July 2016
#

The ''div' contains the metadata

#.cb
  h1
    span class="num" 7
    span class="title" title text...
#

== h1/h2 Title/Part
Shared by all style alteratives. Also share the same CSS font styling, and per Memoir.

== h2/h3 Part/chapter
H2, H3 can optionally be,

#.cb
   h2
     span class="num" 4
     span class="title" title text...
#

NB: The name of the heading i.e. ''chapter', or ''part', appears in some heading styles e.g. ''Chapter 4'.  The data does not appear in HTML. This data is written by, and can be changed in, CSS.



== h4/h5 section/subsection/subsubsection
H2, H3 can optionally be,

#.cb
   h4
     span class="num" 4
     title text...
#

== h3/h4/h5/h6 alternatives
Commented out are some alternate styles for titling.


== h3 alternatives
Commented out are some quick shots at alternate chapter heading styles.


=== Figures

==== Images
A lightly-padded page-width image.

figure
  img
  figcaption (optional)
 


== Table of Contents
HTML has a concept of paging, but the spec outline for paging remains undeveloped in any browser. So page numbers, the primary form of navigation in a book, remain undeveloped.

With this loss of information, the layout of a TOC makes no sense in HTML --- it is a list of contents jambed to a left margin, without the dot separator. Moreover, much of the 'memoir' class is simply concerned with providing control over elements of the table, not with providing pre-defined styles.


The current TOC is restructured into,

section
  h3
  nav class="toc"
    h5
    ul
      li
        span class="num"
        span (title)
      li
        ...

This layout respects the usual connventions for a book index, using chapter and sub-section titles. It retrieves several conventions from 'memoir', for example, the separation of mumbers. It also respects current web markup semantics, and considers wrapping the li items in an anchor.

== CSS Notes
Serif font is used, except for local effects (some section headers).
 


=== Sizing
Is by point.
