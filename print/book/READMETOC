An add-on override for the book.css when used on the web.

Typographic tables of content present considerable problems when transfered to the web. While translation of typographic standards may be instructive, and usable, the TOC layout fails in several ways. First, it must be adjusted to work without page numbers. After that, the layout will be deficient. Human interface guidelines tell us,

@ Even for able users, link areas are preferred to be large.
@ Web links must be clearly demarked as links
@ Different colours are not enough, as they are unusable by the colourblind --- shapes must change

Of these, the adjusted old layout in the printable 'book.css' succeeds in in only one aspect, it is clearly laid out. And it fails in yet another --- book TOCs must often contain a great deal of content, so were designed to be compact, but a web TOC will not have much content.

I suspect old printers would have objected to the current layouts. Not because they could not manage colour, animation or scaling (they took pleasure in demonstrating their effects), but because a TOC is not that important. Titles are nothing, they are a navigation aid to content.

I'm not saying I've solved the problem, but some styles are presented here as a start.

All styles assume an internal anchor inside the list tag wrapping the visible contents.

Unless the TOC fills the page, contained ul tags should be classed 'wide'. That's a start, as the wide styling provided extend internal padding, so the anchor becomes larger.
