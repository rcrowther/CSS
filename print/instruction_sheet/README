= Instruction Sheet
A4 width print-orientated text for instruction sheets.

A few ideas from technical sheets, including the format of the footer and header. 

This sheet is an additional package---for general formatting, it depends on ''book'. The intended effect will not be visible unless ''book', in some form, is imported before this sheet.

A version of ''book' is provided for use in ''test.htm'. The only difference between this stylesheet and the main ''book' stylesheet is that ''komalike' headers are enabled.

The ''instruction_sheet' package overrides book with a wider stock, a ''h1' with a new, very simple style,  and a few other tweaks ...and adds special lead-in boxouts for warnings and notes, and a fancy footer to hold cite information. All text is overridden to sans.

Through ''book', several text-layout features are present.

=== Use of ''instruction sheet'
Link to (or @import) a version of ''book' first.

For an instruction sheet, it is neatest to stick to a title, then use headings below h4 (in ''book', a ''section' heading). You must work awfully hard to justify more than two headings, and the boxouts help. If the disparity in heading size seems unusual, check commercial instruction and spec sheets, they use this effect.

== State of play
?


== HTML

=== Generalities

All content should be surrounded by ''article' or ''section'.

All text should be surrounded by ''p'

=== Titles
''Book' provides six levels of titling. Most instruction sheets will need an h1, and h5 for instruction steps. h3 could be used for parts.



== The footer
In an instruction leaflet, the footer carries much of the meta-data,

#.cb
footer
	div  class="person"
	  author Robert Crowther
#

or,

#.cb
footer
  div class="organisation"
	img class="logo"
    h2 Sensor Systems
    address Aimless Boulevard
    address class="printer"
#

Either of the above can be followed by,

#.cb
  div class="doc-data"
    div class="copyright" Registered trademark of ...
    div class="reference"  HC 58746
	date July 2016
#







== CSS Notes
Sans font is used, except for local effects (some section headers).
 


=== Sizing
Is by point.
