= CSS
Why havn't I done this before? There is a question.

Mostly bone-simple CSS, no animations here. Often a lot of time and research (like plodding though online format specifications or 4000 line Tex files).

All HTML5. Most of the HTML is semantically-inclined, if not adhering to, or illustrating, published microformat standards.

Some CSS Level3, but stable and supported. Much work here not possible in earlier versions of CSS.

All CSS files come with READMEs and test HTML pages.
