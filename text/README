= CSS
Why havn't I done this before? There is a question.

Mostly simple CSS (no animations here), but a lot of time and research.

All HTML5. Most of the HTML is semantically-inclined, if not adhering to a published microformat standard.

Some CSS Level3 (but stable and supported). Much work here not possible in earlier versions.

CSS files come with READMEs and test HTML pages.
