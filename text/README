= CSS
Why havn't I done this before? There is a question.

Mostly simple (no animations here), but covering a lot of time and research.

HTML5. Most of the HTML is semantically-inclined, if not adhering to any published microformat standard.

CSS3. Much work here not possible in earlier versions.

All CSS files come with READMEs and test HTML pages.
