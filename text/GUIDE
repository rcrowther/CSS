CSS variants are provided with test pages to show main features of their display. The test pagews may be definitive. They also may be provided with README files, to explain the HTML required, the aim of the project, etc.


Some of the CSS files depend on HTML which can be generated by TML, or other maarkup processors. For TML, typically, compile with,

tml -v -uml -g htmlCB -wp "../css/.../doc.css" SRC DST

README file compiled with,

tml -v -uml -g markdown ".../css/text/README" ".../css/README"

From the top folder,

tml -v -uml -g markdown "text/README"
